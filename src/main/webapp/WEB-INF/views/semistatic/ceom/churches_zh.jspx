				The main thrusts of the ministry of the Christian Evangelical Oversea Mission 
				are to spread the Gospel of Christ Jesus and to establish churches that are based 
				on God’s truth.  Aside from coordinating all missionary work in America, Europe, 
				Asia, and Africa, the CEOM oversees the establishment of mission churches.  It 
				also sends out and supervises missionaries in order to meet the needs of the 
				mission fields.
			</p> 
			<p>
				At the present, the emphasis of the Christian Evangelical Overseas Mission is for
				the mission churches.  “Mission churches” are 
				those pioneering mission fields where new Christians are gathered together and 
				churches are established.  A mission church is the first step in establishing a 
				C.E.C. It does not matter if one is self-sufficient or if one depends on the 
				support from the Mission Fund.   Each establishment of a C.E.C. starts out as a 
				mission church.  Therefore, within the organization of the Christian Evangelical 
				Overseas Mission, a mission church becomes a foundation for the expansion of the 
				C.E.C.  If a mission church is self-sufficient and does not need the support from
				the Mission Fund, then it becomes a self-supporting church. But if a newly 
				established church is self-supporting, it is still considered a mission church, 
				because although it is financially independent, it still needs to be unified 
				with the operation at the Mission Headquarters.  The status of a church will be 
				determined after a year of evaluation.
			</p>
			<p>
				A mission church is like a new-born baby that needs extra care and nurture.  It 
				needs financial, manpower, and prayer support from brothers and sisters.  So, in 
				the mission field, the C.E.O.M. will fully support the pioneering mission field.
