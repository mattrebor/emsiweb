		Evangelical Bible Institute (EBI) - Introduction</span>

	<p>&#160;</p>


	<section>
		<p>The Evangelical Bible Institute was established by Rev. Moses
			Yang in 1975. Its mission is to train Bible students to become full
			time ministers of God to spread Gospel; and to help laymen grow
			spiritually so to serve God fervently. EBIâ€™s training emphasizes four
			expectations from the students: to walk in faith in their life and
			service; to bring forth spiritual children themselves; to preach
			well; and to lead Bible Study classes so that believers will be
			edified.</p>
		<p>The EBI headquarter is set up in Towaco, N.J. also called EBI
			America. It has branches in Europe and Asia. In Europe, it has
			established EBI Spain; EBI Extension in Paris; and EBI Extension in
			Holland. In Asia, it has established EBI Japan and Bible School for
			Laymen in Taipei. It has also established School for Laymen in
			California.</p>
